# Joni's fabricated reality

![](./images/avatar-photo.jpg)

Hi! I am **Joni Rajala**, 34 year old nerd. I do weird things with my life like woodwoking, board gaming, drawing, programming and phd thesising.

On this website you can find things that I did for the Fab Academy in the spring of 2024. Left side lists all the weekly assignments, and will feature some projects and finished products later.


## Previous work

Before Fab Academy, I have done lots of different things. Not many of them are that great or interesting, but at least there is a lot of them.

### Tukki

Last year I was working at the university creating a ticketing system for teaching, which communicated with the learning management system Moodle. Development just completed and the system is now in maintenance mode and ready for wider use.

### Drawing stuff

Every tuesday I spend 3-4 hours drawing stuff with my computer and try to make my friend laugh at the stupid things that I draw. I'm not that good at it, but 10 years of drawing 3-4 hours a week has done something to my skills. Lately I have been drawing a lot of cute but disturbing creatures.

### Software development

I have worked as a software developer for 4 years from 2014 to 2017 and again in 2022. Most of that time I have spent on health and exercising related projects in startups. I have worked with a team that created and published a personal trainer application for gym goers, and I have worked with programming and electronics of gym equipment.

As far as I am aware, none of those projects are available anymore.


### Programming projects

What kind of nerd does not have a million of started and abandoned programming projects? For me, the abandoned projects are mostly games. The actually useful ones are smaller and personal, so they often are good enough for me. 

One day, I should combine my projects in one place, so that they would be easier to showcase to people.

### Woodworking

For the last two years, I have been participating in a woodworking class. The most useful thing that I have made there is a spice rack for all my different spices. Currently I am working on creating a poker chip set from wood.
